# Pymaceuticals
This code was designed to read in and merge two data sets with information about mice clinical trials. 

-Summary Statistics Table
    The code first generates a summary statistics table, using two seperate methods, showing mean, median, variance, standard deviation and SEM for each drug regimen.
   
- Charts
    The code returns two types of bar graphs (showing total number of timepoints)
    and two types of pie graphs (female to male ratio).
    
- Quartiles & Outliers
    The code calculates quartiles for 4 drug regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin
    The code displays a chart with box and whisker representations of the data.
    
- Scatterplot and Regressions
    The code returns a single line plot showing tumor volume vs. time for a single mouse subject
    The code returns a scatter plot showing average tumor volume compared to mouse weight, with the 
    linear regression shown on the same graph.
